1. (Assume that the value of a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ... , z = 26. You are given a numeric string S. Write a program to return the list of all possible codes that can be generated from the given string.
Note : The order of codes are not important. And input string does not contain 0s.
Input format :

A numeric string

Constraints :
1 <= Length of String S <= 10
Sample Input:

1123

Sample Output:

aabc
kbc
alc
aaw
kw)

2. (Print Subset Sum to K
Send Feedback
Given an array A and an integer K, print all subsets of A which sum to K.
Subsets are of length varying from 0 to n, that contain elements of the array. But the order of elements should remain same as in the input array.
Note : The order of subsets are not important. Just print them in different lines.
Input format :

Line 1 : Size of input array
Line 2 : Array elements separated by space
Line 3 : K

Sample Input:

9
5 12 3 17 1 18 15 3 17
6

Sample Output:

3 3
5 1)

3. (Given a string S, find and return all the possible permutations of the input string.
Note 1 : The order of permutations is not important.
Note 2 : If original string contains duplicate characters, permutations will also be duplicates.
Input Format :

String S

Output Format :

All permutations (in different lines)

Sample Input :

abc

Sample Output :

abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba)
